Gourmet Recipe Manager
-----

Gourmet Recipe is an open source project that enables the user to store, edit, and organize recipes. Additionally it is extendable to different plugins that allow a user to perform actions such as determine the nutritional quality of a recipe. This type of project really appeals to me because I am always trying to find a great aggregation tool for all the recipes I find on the internet. 

The project seems to have a great deal of documentation and well maintained code. The github website is located [here](https://github.com/thinkle/gourmet). Although the project was started by Thomas Hinkle, the majority of the recent work seems to be spearheaded by Bernhard Reiter. There is a wiki within the github page that has plenty of useful information for those that want to contribute to the project. Additionally there is a launchpad website used by the project that has links to a mailing list used by the other developers. If I do go ahead with this project, the mailing list will be a great way of communicating with other more experienced users to see where I might be most valuable to the project.

Overall the project seems to follow pretty standard software engineering practices. For example there is a section, Coding.md, that explains what the desired coding style is for the project. There also seems to be a decent attempt at performing testing as the project moves along, although there is a note that mentions adding unit testing as a possible area for improvement/involvement. One of the most impressive things I've found is the dedication to issue tracking. Within the github website there is a well documented "Issues" section where each issue is given a numerical ID. This way when others want to talk about a specific problem they are having or working on, there is a common reference point for all users. The code itself thanks to the guidelines set out seems fairly ease to read and understand, although they mention making the code more uniform as a task needing attention.

Within this project I see a number of areas where I think I can jump in and hopefully help contribute. There is a helpful link that points to a few issues that are deemed "easy" by the admins. This is likely where I would try and start contributing to the website. Additionally there are a lot of good ideas given by the admins in the "Contribute" section of the wiki that would provide me with plenty of ideas and work once I got into the project.

BrewPi
-----

BrewPi is an open source project that combines the use of software, a Raspberry Pi, and an Arduino shield to help maintain an ideal temperature during the beer making process. Having spent two years out in California making wine, this sort of project really appeals to me since I have first hand experience of just how important tracking things like temperature can be to the finished product.

This project seems to have been around for awhile although the documentation looks like it could probably use a little work. For instance there is a very nice [BrewPi](http://www.brewpi.com) website however the github [website](https://github.com/BrewPi) seems to need more documentation to better explain not only what each repository does, but how it can be improved upon or used int the future. Within each repository, and on the BrewPi website, there does seem to be a decent effort put into issue tracking and resolving. The BrewPi Python script repository, for instance, had an issue solved as recently as 22 days ago, although another issue has remained open since October 2013.

In addition to needing improved documentation, this project would also likely benefit from better organization. The Python script repository has 14 python files in the main folder, some without very helpful names. I assume the brewpi.py file is the main python file, but there is a lack of information in the commented header and without organizing the files into helpful folders it can be difficult to figure out/remember which files rely upon one another. Once the correct file is found the code seems relatively straight forward to understand.

There do appear to be a few test cases being used to help make sure the project is performing correctly. It is unclear whether they are using a Test Driven Development process, although the number of issues being reported and resolved seem to indicate there are good tests being conducted.

In terms of communication it seems like a forum located on the BrewPi website is the prefered method. Here there are some useful sections that help layout a few areas that users can contribute and recommend future improvements. There doesn't seem to be quite as much active dialog on the website as there once was, however there are a few recent posts from just a day or two ago.

This would be a fun project to work on this summer, although my role would likely be on the python script and documentation side rather than the Raspberry Pi and Arduino sections. To really work on those two sections I feel like I would not only need the hardware, but also quite a few weeks/months to tinker with the system and brew some beer. I could also envision supporting the project by trying to create a mobile website/application that takes advantage of the nice web interface already in existence.

Zuluru
-----

Zuluru is an open source program that allows the user to manage sports teams and leagues. I have always loved playing sports since I was young and I know from first hand experience that often the hardest part of managing a team and league is the organization.

The documentation for Zuluru is pretty well organized. The project is based upon code that was released to the public domain with a GPL and is currently being hosted on github. At the website www.zuluru.org there is information about the company that created the software released to the public domain. It explains some of the key features and how the project has been used in the past. On the gihub [website](https://github.com/Zuluru/Zuluru) there is more documenation explaining how to set up the code for your own extension.


The code itself seems pretty well organized and easy to understand. There seems to be a uniform method of writing classes, methods, and attributes with consistent indentation. The readme does a good job of explaining the organization which would be a great help when working to develop/modify the project's individual parts.

One big problem with the code is the lack of test cases. There is a folder where tests could go, however it is one of the areas that has not been modified since the code was uploaded four years ago. The lack of tests can be seen by the lack of issues currently listed on github website.

If I were to work on this project I would likely have to extend it into a project of my own. There doesn't appear to be any ongoing communication on the github website although it does appear as though the code is updated relatively frequently based on the total number of commits with the most recent commit only being a few weeks ago. While I probably won't have the time to fully immerse myself on this project for this class, this is probably a project I will work on in the future. The ability to take a working project and make it my own would be a great challenge and a good continuation of what I hope to learn in this class over the summer.
